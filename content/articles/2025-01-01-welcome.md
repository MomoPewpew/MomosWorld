This site is a journal of creative projects: audio, images, notes, and process.

## What’s in an “article block”?

- A title (clickable)
- A row of tags
- A playlist/gallery of local static files
- A write-up

## Next steps

- Flesh out the content schema
- Improve search (full-text, weights, etc.)
- Add pagination or infinite scroll
