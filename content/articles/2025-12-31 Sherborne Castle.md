I have been given the privilege of introducing a group of wonderful people to the art of roleplay. We will be playing a one-shot session of Honey Heist, a 2017 single page TTRP system which is perfect for beginners.

## Sherborne Castle

Sherborne Castle is a made up location in the modern day English countryside. The Macdonalds will be hosting this year's edition of HoneyCon: A yearly event where the ultra wealthy gather to sample the fruit of the world's most prestigious beekeepers. But a group of rag-tag bears in funny hats have other ideas.

## Theming

I decided to use a nested theme. The story itself takes place in 2026, so the players have access to modern day technology. But HoneyCon itself is being hosted as a LARP event: Current day millionaires gather so that they can pretend to be nobles in a costume drama. This lets us, for at least the one session that this story will fill up, use 21st century heist tropes in conjunction with a fantasy gala.

## Determinate versus indeterminate problems

In designing any story I like to prepare a small amount of problems with determinate solutions, and combine it with more problems that have indeterminate solutions.

In this case: The vault door requires a bejeweled family relic to open. It will be flaunted to the guests during the main ballroom dance event, allowing our bears in funny hats to come up with some funny hi-jinx to procure it without anyone noticing.

This determinate problem combined with the indeterminate problems of a tropy laser field and multiple security guards should give the perfect blend of direction and creative freedom.

## Modular problems

In any story that is supposed to wrap up in a single night, I always like to use modular problems. Something that everyone will enjoy if I choose to use it, but nobody will miss if I scrap it for time constraints. In this case:

- The party is attended by Augustin Vandamme. A world famous detective and author of crime novels. This character is a parody of Agatha Christie’s character “Hercule Poirot”. For the most part he will be a passive attendant. I will let the bears recognize him so that they can decide to make him important by themselves. And if the story goes too fast, Vandamme can put the building on lockdown while he tries to solve “who dunnit”. The bears will have to find an escape.
- The contractor for this mission might decide to double cross the party for their gooey loot. There likely won’t be any time to play this card, but it would be a perfect way to pad the session by another 20 minutes if needed.
